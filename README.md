# AI Trip Advisor – Multi-Agent Travel Planning with CrewAI

This project is an experimental AI-powered travel advisor that utilizes Generative AI and a multi-agent system with CrewAI to create personalized travel recommendations. The system considers user preferences, budget constraints, and travel goals to provide optimized itineraries.
## Features

    Multi-Agent Collaboration: Different AI agents specialize in research, planning, profiling, and budgeting.

    Web Scraping & Search Integration: Uses tools to fetch real-time travel data.

    Customizable Inputs: User can specify their travel preferences, destination, and budget.

    Future Plans: A Streamlit-based frontend will be added for a more interactive experience.
